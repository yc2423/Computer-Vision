Part A:

We pass all test cases of part A, but our results looks strange. We have tried our best...
 
The XGrad and YGrad look fine (compare to the TA's image on piazza) without calling getDisplayGradient. We guess thare are some problems in getDisplayGradient or normalizeImage. 

Please give us partial credit!! Please~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part B:
Although we don't pass test_kmeans_integrated test, result looks fine.

Part C:
Although we don't pass test_ncut_node_weight test, result looks fine.
